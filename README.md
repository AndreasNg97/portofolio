# MY PORTOFOLIO!!
This is a website written in react.
This website is in the making, and I will try to document my code as much as possible.
The main reason for making this Portofolio is to display my skills and personality in a fun and cool way.

## Placeholders
most of the pictures in the website is only a placeholder, but as you can see, most of the content is is also a placeholder.

## BUGS
- In the skills/Projects section there is a bug with the ScrollTrigger start & end  position. Everytime the page get refreshed, the start and end postition on the trigger the height gets offset. (Working on squashing this bug)
